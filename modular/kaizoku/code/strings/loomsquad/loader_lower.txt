Low angle- WATCH THE RICOCHET!!! FUCK!
Bolt'll skip if you rush it.
Close work- Keep this shit tight.
Stone won't stop that weight...
That's a pin- PULL IT OFF!

... Are they suicidal?
... Should we kill 'em with blades now?
Bolting it down.
I can barely see with this- SHIT ON!
Explosions ready, if they break this...
